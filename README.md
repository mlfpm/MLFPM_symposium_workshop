# MLFPM symposium workshop

This repository contains everything you need to follow the Machine Learning Frontiers in Precision Medicine (MLFPM) student workshop, happening in Munich on Tuesday, 18/10/2022.

The session is divided in two parts:

1) Medical imaging classification and explainability
2) Network-based genome-wide association studies - GWAS

### Part 1 setup

For part 1, we will run a Google [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) (with GPU access), 
and use a [chest X-ray dataset hosted in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). 
This means that you'll need both Google and Kaggle accounts to proceed. You can find instructions on this 
regard [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Once that's taken care of, and in order to access the data, you should activate a Kaggle API key. Once logged in to Kaggle,
you should see a menu called "API" under the 'Account' menu (that you can access when you click your small picture 
in the top-right corner of the screen). Once there, click on "Create new API token". This should download a file called
"kaggle.json". When opening it, you should see your user name and an automatically generated password. Don't lose it; we'll
need it for the next step!

Last but not least, let's load the project in google colab. [Still working on the best way to do this. Updates soon!]
